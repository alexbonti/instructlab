If we have accepted a claim caused by an Insured Event in this Section 1 and the tenant has vacated leaving their possessions at the property, then we will pay up to $500 per tenancy for costs you incur (over and above the bond amount) for:
u  The removal of the tenant’s possessions from the property, and
u  For the storage of the possessions for the time required by the Act.
Reletting expenses in excess of the bond
If we have accepted a claim for an Insured Event under Section 1 of this Policy, we will also pay up to $500 during any one period of insurance for reletting expenses that exceed the tenant’s bond money.
This benefit will only apply if:
u  Bond money, equivalent to 4 weeks rent has been collected from the tenant, and 
u  The bond money has been fully exhausted.
Re-letting expenses that do not exceed the tenant’s bond money are not claimable under this Policy.
Conditions – Section 1
A claim under ‘Section 1– Loss of rent’ may be refused or reduced if the following terms and conditions have not been met or followed.
Rent is in arrears at commencement of policy
If the tenant’s rent payments were in arrears in the 2 months prior to the commencement of the Policy, then rent cover is not available unless the ‘Rent arrears’ clause has been met – refer to ‘General Terms and Conditions’ on page 66 for this clause.
Loss of rent before commencement of policy
We do not cover loss of rent, for any period before the commencement of the initial period of insurance.
Breach notices are not issued 
We may reduce or refuse your rent arrears claim if you or your Property Manager:
u  Fail to issue or delay issuing rent arrears and termination notices to the tenant, or
u  Fail to pursue or delay pursuing a court or tribunal order for the eviction of the tenant following the expiry of the breach or termination notice.
The above processes should be followed in accordance with the Tenancy Act in the State or Territory in which your property is located.
Failure to repair and re-let
You or your Property Manager must demonstrate that all reasonable steps have been taken to repair and re-let the property as soon as possible after the departure of the tenant or damage is discovered. If you fail to do so, we will commence the loss of rent claim from the point in time that it would have been reasonable to have repaired any damage and attempted to re-let the property.
Delaying repairs
If you cause unreasonable delays in commencing or carrying out any repair or rebuilding work, we will reduce the rental income benefit to take into account any loss of rent that results from your delay.
Market conditions
This Policy does not cover your inability to rent the premises due to adverse market conditions. This means that if none of the Insured Events covered by Section 1 has occurred and the conditions of the rental market dictate that a vacancy period will be sustained between tenancies, the Policy will not cover that loss.
Alternate accommodation
Section 1 does not provide cover for alternate accommodation costs for the tenant as a result of the property becoming untenantable for any reason.
Vacant at time of loss
Cover under Insured Events g) Untenantable (building),         
h) Untenantable (contents) and i) Prevention of access of this Policy Section 1, will only apply when:
u  The property was tenanted immediately prior to, or at the time of it becoming untenantable or when access was prevented, or
u  You can demonstrate that the property would have been tenanted had the loss not occurred. 
Basis on which claims are paid
Weekly rent
The maximum weekly loss of rent that is recoverable under this Policy is the weekly rent sum insured shown on your Policy Schedule.
How we calculate what we will pay Loss of rent is calculated using either:
u  The weekly rent of the tenant in accordance with their current Lease, or
u  The weekly rent sum insured on your Policy Schedule,  	 whichever is less.
This is then multiplied by the number of week’s loss of rent that you are entitled to under this Policy.
This amount is then reduced by:
u  Any bond monies left over after subtracting allowable      re-letting expenses*, 
u  Any break fee, which the tenant has paid under their Lease, and u  Any applicable rent excess shown on your Policy Schedule. 
The resultant amount, if it exceeds the Policy Limit that applies to the event being claimed, is then reduced to that Policy limit.
*Re-letting expenses include but are not limited to: u  General/carpet cleaning, u  Gardening costs & rubbish removal, u  Water usage, letting fees and advertising, and u  The cost of minor repairs which are not covered by this or any other insurance as a result of a policy excess.
Claims for more than one Insured Event 
Where a claim is possible under more than one of the Insured Events of this Section, you may only claim under one of those Insured Events for any one period of rent loss.

General terms and conditions
Payment of premium
You must pay your annual premium by 4.00pm on the due date. If we do not receive your premium by this time or your payment is dishonoured, this Policy will not start and there will be no cover – if you have not paid, you are not insured.
You can pay your premium in one annual payment by cash, cheque, postal order, MasterCard, Visa or BPay.
Important conditions
Cover provided by this Policy is only applicable where: u  Your property is managed by a Property Manager, and u  There is a Lease in place between you and the tenant.

Actions and advice by or from your property manager u  Any notification, advice or discovery made to or by your Property Manager is considered to have been made to or by you.
u  Any action taken or that should have been taken by your Property Manager is considered to be an act or omission by you.
Rent arrears
If the tenant was in rent arrears either at the commencement of the initial period of insurance (or in the 2 months prior), the following condition applies:
u  Cover will be limited to Section 2: ‘Contents’, (but excluding malicious damage) and Section 4: ‘Liability to Others’ of this policy. If the tenant subsequently brings their rental payments out of rent arrears for a period of two consecutive months, then these limitations will not apply from the end of that two month period or the date of the commencement of the initial period of insurance, whichever occurs last.
Bond monies
Your Policy settlement will operate on the basis that bond monies equivalent to at least four weeks rent have been collected. This applies regardless of whether a full bond has been collected.
In the event of loss of or damage to your property caused by the tenant, you will use the bond money to minimise your loss. If you have voluntarily returned the bond money to the tenant, and you lodge a claim for loss of or damage to your property, we will reduce any amount we pay by the amount of prejudice we have suffered as a result of your actions.
Unoccupied properties

Unoccupied means that the property was vacant for the 90 day period immediately before loss or damage occurred.
